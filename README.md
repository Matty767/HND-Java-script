# JavaScript Tasks for Input Validation, Value Formatting, and Coin Calculation

This project contains several JavaScript tasks focusing on form validation, value formatting, and parameter passing, as well as a task to calculate coin breakdowns for a given monetary amount. These tasks demonstrate key JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, input validation, and interactive user feedback.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the form inputs for user email, username, and coin calculation.
- **style.css**: Includes basic styles for form layout and message display.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for all tasks, including input validation, value formatting, and coin breakdown calculation.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. **Email and Username Validation**
This task validates the user's email and username when submitted via a form.

- **Features**:
  - Validates email format (e.g., `user@example.com`).
  - Validates that the username meets certain criteria (e.g., no special characters, minimum length).
  - Error messages are displayed in real-time using DOM manipulation within `<span>` elements.
  - JavaScript checks that both inputs are correct before allowing form submission.

- **How to Run**:
  - Open the form, enter an email and username, and submit. Errors will be displayed directly below the input fields if validation fails.

### 2. **Value Formatting**
This task takes a user input and automatically converts the value to uppercase as the user types.

- **Features**:
  - Automatically formats the value to uppercase while the user types.
  - No need to submit the form; the formatting happens in real-time.

- **How to Run**:
  - Begin typing in the designated input field, and the characters will change to uppercase automatically.

### 3. **Random Number Generation**
This task generates a random number between a specified range when requested.

- **Features**:
  - The user can define the minimum and maximum range for random number generation.
  - The result is displayed on the page.

- **How to Run**:
  - Input the minimum and maximum values, click the "Generate" button, and see the result displayed on the page.

### 4. **Coin Breakdown Calculation**
This task calculates how many 50p, 20p, and 10p coins can be given for an entered amount of money.

- **Features**:
  - Input validation ensures that the entered value is a valid number before performing calculations.
  - Calculates how many 50p, 20p, and 10p coins are needed to match the given amount of money.
  - Displays the results directly on the page in a format like "2 x 50p coins, 5 x 20p coins, 10 x 10p coins."
  - All results and error messages are shown on the page without the use of alert boxes.

- **How to Run**:
  - Enter an amount of money in pounds (Â£).
  - The system will calculate how many 50p, 20p, and 10p coins are needed and display the result.
